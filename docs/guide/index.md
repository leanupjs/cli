# Guide

The `@leanup stack` only contains the selected tools and their default configuration. No specific things are implemented, such as a dedicated CLI.

This means that all commands for developing, testing or building etc. the app relate to the configuration of the `npm scripts`.

## Technical risks

The technical risks are minimal, because their is no own stuff inside. You can change each individual tool if you want.
